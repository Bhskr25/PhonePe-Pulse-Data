#### Prerequests and Needs
The needs of this project can be categorized into several key aspects. Here is a list of the essential needs

1. **Python Libraries:**
   - The project requires various Python libraries, including:
     - `plotly.express`: For creating visually appealing plots and graphs.
     - `mysql-connector`: For connecting with MySQL database.
     - `pandas`: For data transformation, manipulation and analysis.
     - `streamlit`: For creating the interactive web application.
       
2. **Data Visualization with Plotly:**
   - Plotly is utilized extensively to create interactive and visually appealing plots such as scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, choropleth maps to enable users to explore and analyze transaction data in a dynamic and engaging manner.

3. **Streamlit Web Application:**
   - Streamlit should be installed to run the web application for user interaction and data presentation.

4. **Database Services:**
   - MySQL database should be available or set up for data analysis and transformation to get required results from the pulse data.

5. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Users might require basic understanding and knowledge of Pandas and Plotly for data analysis, and streamlit to visualize the data.

6. **Environment Setup:**
    - Proper Python environment setup with necessary dependencies installed.

7. **Internet Connection:**
    - An active internet connection is needed to fetch data from the YouTube API.
